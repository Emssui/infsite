            <h1>Wealth</h1>
            <p>At the start of 2020, Musk had a net worth of $27 billion. By the year's end his net worth had increased by $150 billion, mostly driven by his ownership of around 20% of Tesla stock. During this, Musk's net worth was often volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the largest single-day plunge in Bloomberg Billionaires Index's history</p>
